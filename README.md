COVID-19 Chest X-ray Diagnosis Using Transfer Learning with Google Xception Model

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, is rapidly spreading across the world and creating serious health and economic issues. Although the gold standard for diagnosing the COVID-19 disease is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, a chest x-ray may be a valuable addition to the diagnostic toolbox.
Using the COVID-Net Open Source Initiative dataset, I trained three machine learning models to differentiated between chest x-ray findings from COVID-19 disease, other non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy lung to speed up a teams ability to test for the virus.
